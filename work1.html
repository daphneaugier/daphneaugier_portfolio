                        </div>
                        <p>Caché is a modern neighborhood bistro in San Francisco, offering a relaxed yet refined French bistro atmosphere. As the designer and developer, I took on the responsibility of creating the entire visual identity for the website, including logo design and branding, to bring the desired brand image to life.</p>
                        <h3>The Request</h3>
                        <p>The project involved designing and developing a website that would serve as a showcase for the restaurant. The key features included:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Identity:</b> Developing a visual identity that captures Caché's "relaxed French bistro" style, including creating the logo and the website's graphic elements.</li>
                            <li><b>Essential Information:</b> Presenting the menu, opening hours, and contact details in an engaging and accessible way.</li>
                            <li><b>Online Reservations:</b> Integrating a simple and intuitive reservation system to enhance the customer experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The main goal was to reflect Caché's atmosphere while providing an enjoyable and accessible user experience.</p>
                        <h3>Design Approach (UX/UI)</h3>
                        <h4>Research and Inspiration</h4>
                        <p>I started with an in-depth research phase, studying the aesthetics of traditional French bistros and drawing inspiration from modern architecture and design. This approach helped me create a unique blend that captured Caché's personality. I created a user flow to understand in terms of functionality and navigation.</p> 
                        <h4>Developing the Visual Identity</h4>
                        <p>From there, I developed a visual identity that matched the atmosphere Florent, the owner of Caché, wanted to convey. The logo needed to be simple, memorable, and adaptable across different media, so I chose to create it by handwriting the design and vectorizing it in Illustrator. I picked a color palette that evoked the warmth of a bistro while keeping a touch of modernity and freshness, using neutral tones with accent colors to draw attention to key elements.</p> 
                        <p>For the typography, I focused on ensuring it was both elegant and easy to read, reflecting the sophistication and modernity of the restaurant. Images played a central role in the site, with high-quality photos of dishes, ambiance, and decor used to immediately engage users.</p>
                        <h4>Wireframes and Prototypes</h4>
                        <p>To structure the site's content, I designed several wireframes in Figma. My focus was to ensure that users could easily find the information they needed, with a clear and intuitive navigation structure. I mapped out specific user journeys to address the main needs: exploring the menu, making a reservation, and finding practical information. Given that reservations are a key feature, I designed both desktop and mobile wireframes to make this functionality highly accessible.</p> 
                        <p>Once the wireframes were approved, I created interactive prototypes in Figma, allowing Florent to visualize the site before the development stage. This approach allowed me to gather detailed feedback and make necessary adjustments before moving forward with the final build.</p>
